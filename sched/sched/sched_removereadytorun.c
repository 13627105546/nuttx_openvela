 * Name: nxsched_remove
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function removes a TCB from the task list.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   rtcb - Points to the TCB
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   true if the currently active task (the head of the running list)
 *     has changed.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The caller has established a critical section before calling this
 *   function (calling sched_lock() first is NOT a good idea -- use
 *   enter_critical_section()).
 * - The caller handles the condition that occurs if the head of the
 *   running list is changed.
