/****************************************************************************
 * Address Environment Interfaces
 *
 * Low-level interfaces used in binfmt/ to instantiate tasks with address
 * environments.  These interfaces all operate on type arch_addrenv_t which
 * is an abstract representation of a task group's address environment and
 * must be defined in arch/arch.h if CONFIG_ARCH_ADDRENV is defined.
 *
 *   up_addrenv_create   - Create an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_destroy  - Destroy an address environment.
 *   up_addrenv_vtext    - Returns the virtual base address of the .text
 *                         address environment
 *   up_addrenv_vdata    - Returns the virtual base address of the .bss/.data
 *                         address environment
 *   up_addrenv_heapsize - Returns the size of the initial heap allocation.
 *   up_addrenv_select   - Instantiate an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_clone    - Copy an address environment from one location to
 *                         another.
 *
 * Higher-level interfaces used by the tasking logic.  These interfaces are
 * used by the functions in sched/ and all operate on the thread which whose
 * group been assigned an address environment by up_addrenv_clone().
 *
 *   up_addrenv_attach   - Clone the address environment assigned to one TCB
 *                         to another.  This operation is done when a pthread
 *                         is created that share's the same group address
 *                         environment.
 *   up_addrenv_detach   - Release the thread's reference to an address
 *                         environment when a task/thread exits.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_KERNEL_STACK is selected, then each user process will have
 * two stacks:  (1) a large (and possibly dynamic) user stack and (2) a
 * smaller kernel stack.  However, this option is *required* if both
 * CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL and CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS are selected.  Why?  Because
 * when we instantiate and initialize the address environment of the new
 * user process, we will temporarily lose the address environment of the old
 * user process, including its stack contents.  The kernel C logic will crash
 * immediately with no valid stack in place.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_KERNEL_STACK=y is selected then the platform specific
 * code must export these additional interfaces:
 *
 *   up_addrenv_kstackalloc  - Create a stack in the kernel address
 *                             environment
 *   up_addrenv_kstackfree   - Destroy the kernel stack.

 * Name: up_addrenv_create
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called when a new task is created in order to
 *   instantiate an address environment for the new task group.
 *   up_addrenv_create() is essentially the allocator of the physical
 *   memory for the new task.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   textsize - The size (in bytes) of the .text address environment needed
 *     by the task.  This region may be read/execute only.
 *   datasize - The size (in bytes) of the .data/.bss address environment
 *     needed by the task.  This region may be read/write only.  NOTE: The
 *     actual size of the data region that is allocated will include a
 *     OS private reserved region at the beginning.  The size of the
 *     private, reserved region is give by ARCH_DATA_RESERVE_SIZE.
 *   heapsize - The initial size (in bytes) of the heap address environment
 *     needed by the task.  This region may be read/write only.
 *   addrenv - The location to return the representation of the task address
 *     environment.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success; a negated errno value on failure.
