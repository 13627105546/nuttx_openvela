ESP32S3-DevKit
==============

The `ESP32S3 DevKit <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/hw-reference/esp32s3/user-guide-devkitc-1.html>`_ is a development board for the ESP32-S3 SoC from Espressif, based on a ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module.

Features
========

  - ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 Module
  - USB-to-UART bridge via micro USB port
  - Power LED
  - EN and BOOT buttons (BOOT accessible to user)
  - SPI FLASH (size varies according to model

Serial Console
==============

UART0 is, by default, the serial console.  It connects to the on-board
CP2102 converter and is available on the USB connector USB CON8 (J1).

It will show up as /dev/ttyUSB[n] where [n] will probably be 0.

Buttons and LEDs
================

Buttons
-------

There are two buttons labeled Boot and EN.  The EN button is not available
to software.  It pulls the chip enable line that doubles as a reset line.

The BOOT button is connected to IO0.  On reset it is used as a strapping
pin to determine whether the chip boots normally or into the serial
bootloader.  After reset, however, the BOOT button can be used for software
input.

LEDs
----

There are several on-board LEDs for that indicate the presence of power
and USB activity.  None of these are available for use by software.

Configurations
==============

.. tip:: Please check commonly used configurations for
  :ref:`ESP32-S3 Peripherals <esp32s3_peripheral_support>`

nsh
---

Basic NuttShell configuration (console enabled in UART0, exposed via
USB connection by means of CP2102 converter, at 115200 bps).

mcuboot_nsh
-----------

Similar configuration as nsh, except that it enables booting from
MCUboot and the experimental features configuration.

You can find more information on the `example's documentation <https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/blob/master/examples/mcuboot/swap_test/README.md>`_.

oneshot
-------

This config demonstrate the use of oneshot timers present on the ESP32-S3.
To test it, just run the ``oneshot`` example::

    nsh> oneshot
    Opening /dev/oneshot
    Maximum delay is 4294967295999999
    Starting oneshot timer with delay 2000000 microseconds
    Waiting...
    Finished

psram_quad
----------

This config tests the PSRAM driver over SPIRAM interface in quad mode.
You can use the mm command to test the PSRAM memory::

    nsh> mm
        mallinfo:
          Total space allocated from system = 8803232
          Number of non-inuse chunks        = 2
          Largest non-inuse chunk           = 8388592
          Total allocated space             = 9672
          Total non-inuse space             = 8793560
    (0)Allocating 5011 bytes

    ......

    (31)Releasing memory at 0x3fc8c088 (size=24 bytes)
        mallinfo:
          Total space allocated from system = 8803232
          Number of non-inuse chunks        = 2
          Largest non-inuse chunk           = 8388592
          Total allocated space             = 9672
          Total non-inuse space             = 8793560
    TEST COMPLETE

psram_octal
-----------

Similar to the ```psram_quad``` configuration but using the SPIRAM
interface in octal mode.

pwm
---

This configuration demonstrates the use of PWM through a LED connected to GPIO2.
To test it, just execute the ``pwm`` application::

    nsh> pwm
    pwm_main: starting output with frequency: 10000 duty: 00008000
    pwm_main: stopping output

random
------

This configuration shows the use of the ESP32-S3's True Random Number Generator with
entropy sourced from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth noise.
To test it, just run ``rand`` to get 32 randomly generated bytes::

    nsh> rand
    Reading 8 random numbers
    Random values (0x3ffe0b00):
    0000  98 b9 66 a2 a2 c0 a2 ae 09 70 93 d1 b5 91 86 c8  ..f......p......
    0010  8f 0e 0b 04 29 64 21 72 01 92 7c a2 27 60 6f 90  ....)d!r..|.'`o.

smp
---

Another NSH configuration, similar to nsh, but also enables
SMP operation.  It differs from the nsh configuration only in these
additional settings:

SMP is enabled::

  CONFIG_SMP=y
  CONFIG_SMP_NCPUS=2
  CONFIG_SPINLOCK=y

The apps/testing/smp test is included::

  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP=y
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_NBARRIER_THREADS=8
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_PRIORITY=100
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_STACKSIZE=2048

spiflash
--------

This config tests the external SPI that comes with the ESP32-S3 module connected
through SPI1.

By default a SmartFS file system is selected.
Once booted you can use the following commands to mount the file system::

    nsh> mksmartfs /dev/smart0
    nsh> mount -t smartfs /dev/smart0 /mnt

Note that mksmartfs is only needed the first time.

sta_softap
----------

With this configuration you can run these commands to be able
to connect your smartphone or laptop to your board::

  nsh> ifup wlan1
  nsh> dhcpd_start wlan1
  nsh> wapi psk wlan1 mypasswd 3
  nsh> wapi essid wlan1 nuttxap 1

In this case, you are creating the access point ``nuttxapp`` in your board and to
connect to it on your smartphone you will be required to type the password ``mypasswd``
using WPA2.

.. tip:: Please refer to :ref:`ESP32 Wi-Fi SoftAP Mode <esp32_wi-fi_softap>`
  for more information.

The ``dhcpd_start`` is necessary to let your board to associate an IP to your smartphone.

tickless
--------

This configuration enables the support for tickless scheduler mode.

timer
-----

This config test the general use purpose timers. It includes the 4 timers,
adds driver support, registers the timers as devices and includes the timer
example.

To test it, just run the following::

  nsh> timer -d /dev/timerx

Where x in the timer instance.

wifi
----

Enables Wi-Fi support. You can define your credentials this way::

    $ make menuconfig
    -> Application Configuration
        -> Network Utilities
            -> Network initialization (NETUTILS_NETINIT [=y])
                -> WAPI Configuration

Or if you don't want to keep it saved in the firmware you can do it
at runtime::

    nsh> wapi psk wlan0 mypasswd 3
    nsh> wapi essid wlan0 myssid 1
    nsh> renew wlan0

.. tip:: Please refer to :ref:`ESP32 Wi-Fi Station Mode <esp32_wi-fi_sta>`
  for more information.

watchdog
--------

This config test the watchdog timers. It includes the 2 MWDTS,
adds driver support, registers the WDTs as devices and includes the watchdog
example.

To test it, just run the following::

  nsh> wdog -i /dev/watchdogx

Where x is the watchdog instance.
